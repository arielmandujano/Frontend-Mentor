# My solution for the Product preview card component in Frontend Mentor

This is the second challenge in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) I work with. 

## The challenge üå™

This [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa) consists on replicate a product preview card with some design changes for desktop and mobile views. 

## My solution üßû

For this challenge I replicate the views using only _**HTML**_ and _**CSS**_, for the responsive design I used media queries when defining the styles.

## An important note ‚úç

As I am not interested in presenting my solutions in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) some of the styles may differ from those recommended by the challenge creator, I know, these changes are just for personal taste.
