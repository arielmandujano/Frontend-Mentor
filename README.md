# About this repository ☀️


This repository was created to store all the Frontend Mentor challenges I work with, it has no other purpose than to keep track of my progress. 

If you want to try for yourself you can find some interesting challenges at [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). 

The implementations in this repository are based on my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and should not be used as a reference of any type (at least for now).
