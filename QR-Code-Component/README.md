# My solution for the QR code component in Frontend Mentor 

This is my **first** attempt at solving a challenge in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## The challenge üí´

This [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) is to replicate a card with an image and some extra information. For my solution I have used only _**HTML**_ and _**CSS**_. 

## An important note ‚úç

As I am not interested in presenting my solutions in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) some of the styles may differ from those recommended by the challenge creator, I know, these changes are just for personal taste.
